# Sub-skill: Build / update the Voice & Brand Profile

Builds or refreshes `../../../references/voice-profile.md` so every writing skill in
this bundle drafts in the user's real voice instead of a generic "human" voice.
Runs on any agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw): the core path needs only the
user's own writing pasted in. A read token (Apify) is an optional accelerator,
never required.

## When this runs

- User says "build my voice profile", "learn my voice", or invokes
  `ig-humanizer --mode profile`.
- Also offer it the first time a writing skill runs and finds `filled: no`.

## Inputs (any one is enough)

1. **Pasted samples (portable default).** Ask for 3-6 of the user's own real
   Instagram posts. This alone is enough; no token, no history needed.
2. **Read-layer assisted (optional).** If a token is configured, pull the user's
   recent activity via the bundle's read layer as extra samples, on top of pasted ones.
3. **Manual.** The user can also just state their niche, rules, and links.

## Steps

1. Gather 3+ real samples of the user's writing.
2. Extract the voice fingerprint from the samples, not from assumptions: sentence
   rhythm, recurring openers, punctuation habits, favored vocabulary, words they
   avoid, emoji/hashtag behavior.
3. Infer niche, ICP, and pillars from the sample topics; confirm rather than guess.
4. Capture hard rules and CTA/link style the samples reveal or the user states.
5. Write `../../../references/voice-profile.md`: fill sections 1-5, copy the 2-4
   strongest lines verbatim into "Signature examples", and set the Status block to
   `filled: yes`, `source: <pasted|read-layer|manual>`, `updated: <today>`.
6. Show the filled profile for approval before saving; tell the user every writing
   skill will now match it automatically.

## Hard rules

- Build the fingerprint from the user's ACTUAL samples. Never invent a voice.
- Preserve their quirks (a favorite phrase, an unusual rhythm). Those are the
  point; only the generic AI-tell scrub applies to drafts later, not to the profile.
- With only 3 samples, say it is a first pass; suggest re-running after 10+ posts.
- Never put anything the user did not provide into the file.

## Related

- The filled profile is read by this bundle's writing skills before they draft.
- Re-run any time the user's voice or focus shifts.
