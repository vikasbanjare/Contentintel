# Instagram Audience Insights

Turn real Instagram data into a read on what is working: which posts in your niche are traveling right now and why, and how any account (yours or a competitor's) actually performs. This is the read layer, so the skill sees real numbers instead of guessing.

One honest limit: Instagram caps and cookie-gates who **liked** or **commented** on someone else's post, so a liker or commenter roster is not reliably available for other accounts. The signal here is **niche post performance + profile stats**, which is what you can actually read on Instagram.

## When to use

- "What is working in my niche / scan the #hashtag"
- "Pull the stats for this account / how big is this competitor"
- "What format is traveling under this hashtag right now"
- "Compare my follower count to this account"

Not for writing a caption (use `ig-caption-writer`) or planning a carousel (use `ig-carousel-planner`).

## Setup (optional)

The read layer uses **Apify** (no login, no cookies). Get a free token at `https://console.apify.com/account/integrations` and set `APIFY_TOKEN`. No token? Paste the posts or profile stats you already have and the skill runs the same analysis on them.

## Input

- A niche hashtag (with or without the `#`), a username (yours or a competitor's), or both
- Optional: the goal (niche pulse / competitor read / self benchmark)

## Output

1. **Niche pulse** - the top posts under a hashtag ranked by engagement, with the pattern behind the winners (hook shape, caption length, image vs carousel vs Reel, presence of a question or a specific number)
2. **Profile read** - the stats for a handle: followers, post count, bio, category, verified and business flags
3. **Benchmark** - your account against a competitor on follower count and post cadence, normalized so a small account's breakout is not buried under a big account's average
4. **Action list** - what format to make more of, which accounts to watch, what to route to `ig-caption-writer` or `ig-carousel-planner`

## Steps

1. **Pull the data.** For a niche: `lib.ApifyClient().fetch_niche_posts(hashtag, max_items=20)`. For a profile: `fetch_profile(username)`. Falls back to pasted data if no token.
2. **Rank by engagement.** Sort the niche posts by likes + comments. Normalize against the owner's reach where known so a mega-account's average does not crowd out a small account's breakout.
3. **Extract the pattern.** For the top posts, name what they share: the hook shape (question, confession, list, data-point), the caption length, image vs carousel vs Reel, the presence of a specific number. That is the repeatable part.
4. **Read the profile.** From `fetch_profile`, report followers, post count, bio, category, and whether it is a verified business account. Use it to benchmark, not to guess private engagement.
5. **Benchmark honestly.** Compare handles on the stats Instagram exposes (followers, post count, cadence). Do not imply access to a liker or commenter list for accounts you do not own.
6. **Build the action list.** Make-more-of (the winning format), watch (specific accounts), route drafts to `ig-caption-writer` / `ig-carousel-planner`.
7. **Deliver the report** in the Output shape, with the raw ranked posts and profile stats attached.

## What the read layer exposes

| Method | Returns |
|---|---|
| `fetch_niche_posts(hashtag, max_items)` | top posts under a hashtag: caption, likes, comments, owner, type, url |
| `fetch_profile(username)` | profile stats: username, followers, following, posts, bio, category, verified, business |

## Hard rules

Global voice rules: see root `SKILL.md` Voice rules. Additional skill-specific rules:

- Be honest that Instagram hides **who liked or commented** on other accounts. This is **niche discovery + profile stats**, not a liker or engager roster. Do not imply otherwise.
- **Normalize by follower count** before calling a post a winner, or you extract "big account" effects, not "good post" effects.
- Never invent a post, a number, or a pattern. If a hashtag returns thin, say so and try an adjacent tag or pull known accounts.
- A pattern is only a pattern if it recurs across several top posts, not one.
